###  Description:
The mod consists of 3 new items: the Dark Pylon, Dark Mote, and Dark Matter. 

The Dark Pylon is used to transform most mats into Dark Motes. You can do so by placing them in its container and letting the Dark Pylon exchange them while you are doing something else. 

Dark Motes are used to craft Dark Matter or various other items, including the Dark Pylon. 
They are acquired by destroying Gold Nuggets or by using the Dark Pylon after crafting it. 

Dark Matter breaks and drops a few random items when dropped on the ground; it also deals a random amount of damage to the player, the maximum amount is configurable. 
There's a 5% chance to spawn a hostile mob instead of dropping items, a 0.1% chance to spawn a boss, or a 0.01% chance to hit the jackpot and drop 100 times more items.

The recipes are found on the Refine tab.
